# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to [this year's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
This year, I used Python to get the job done.

The code is neither particularly nice nor optimized.

### Requirements:
* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `sympy` (symbolic computation)
* `networkx` (graph algorithms)
* `llist` (Linked lists)
* `pulp` (ILPs)
* `tqdm` (progress bars)
